# DonutSpawn Configuration
# Creates donut-shaped random spawn areas with GriefPrevention awareness

# Maximum attempts to find a valid spawn location before falling back to world spawn
max-attempts: 50

# Safety checks for spawn locations
safety:
  # Check for solid ground (not air, water, lava)
  require-solid-ground: true
  # Minimum Y level for spawns
  min-y: 63
  # Maximum Y level for spawns (255 = no limit, uses world surface)
  max-y: 255
  # Avoid spawning in these biomes (empty = allow all)
  blocked-biomes: []
  # Example: blocked-biomes: [OCEAN, DEEP_OCEAN, FROZEN_OCEAN]

# Spawn zones - players will randomly spawn in one of these areas
# Each zone is a "donut" shape: spawns between inner-radius and outer-radius
zones:
  # Example zone - modify or add your own
  main:
    # World this zone is in
    world: world
    # Center coordinates
    center-x: 0
    center-z: 0
    # Inner radius (exclusion zone) - no spawns within this distance of center
    inner-radius: 100
    # Outer radius - no spawns beyond this distance from center
    outer-radius: 500
    # Weight for random selection (higher = more likely to be chosen)
    # Useful if you want some zones to be more common than others
    weight: 1.0

  # You can add multiple zones like this:
  # secondary:
  #   world: world
  #   center-x: 5000
  #   center-z: 5000
  #   inner-radius: 50
  #   outer-radius: 300
  #   weight: 0.5

# Messages (supports color codes with &)
messages:
  spawned: "&aWelcome! You've spawned in a random location."
  fallback: "&eNo valid spawn found, using world spawn."
  # Set to empty string to disable the message
  # spawned: ""
